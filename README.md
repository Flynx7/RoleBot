**Hello David!**

**Here's what you have to do:**

**List of commands:**

<help
*Embed message of command lists

<listroles
*Embed message of role lists

Commands:

**<apply**
*Duplicated commands* : **<add ; <add-role ; <addrole - apply for a role in the server**

**<help** 
*Duplicated commands* : **none - lists the commands as an embed**

**<remove** 
*Duplicated commands* : **<rm ; <del ; <delete ; <dl - removes a role from a user only if the person performing this has the role of an moderator**

**<rank**
*Duplicated commands* : **<rankroles ; <rankrole ; <rank-role ; <rank-roles - lists the roles in the guild in the order it is arranged**

**You have to configure index.js to:**

1. Once we add the applicant to the #role-verification channel, the bot has to ask the applicant questions for the applied role.
2. The bot has to ask the applicant questions one-after-another, i.e. when the first question is answered by the applicant, the second question is asked.
3. The bot has to send the commands as an embed.
4. The questions are sent as a normal message.
5. The role applied for has to be paired with the corresponding role's questions. 

**The question files will be prepared by me and B3RSERK together.**
**Only these 5 things need to be done.**
**Please do the needful.**
**Thank you.**
